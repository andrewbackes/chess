# Position

Position is a go package that provides a chess board and game state 
representation. With this package you can work with chess boards, squares
and moves. Internally, bitboards are used for piece location so that move
generation is quick.

## How to get it
If you have your GOPATH set in the recommended way ([golang.org](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)):

```go get github.com/andrewbackes/chess/position```

otherwise you can clone the repo.
